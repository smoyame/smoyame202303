# Personal Portfolio 2023

Samanta Moya Medina

## What I've used and what I'm learning

I'm using libraries I'm comfortable with but also want to learn new CMS' and HTML preprocessors.

- Comfortable with Pug --> Learning Nunjucks
- Comfortable with NetlifyCMS --> Learning Strapi CMS
- Using some super basic Webpack bundling to keep...
- Using GSAP's libraries that are only accessable through node packages
- and maybe I'll peek into a lightbox, smoothscroll, or utility library or something!
