## ðŸ”– What I've used and what I'm learning

I'm using libraries I'm comfortable with but also want to learn new CMS' and HTML preprocessors.

- Comfortable with Pug --> Learning Nunjucks
- Comfortable with NetlifyCMS --> Explored Strapi CMS --> Learning Sanity Headless CMS
- Confortable with 11ty static site generator --> I could be better! Sticking to it.
- Using some super basic Webpack bundling to keep...
- Using GSAP's libraries that are only accessable through node packages
- and maybe I'll peek into a lightbox, smoothscroll, or utility library or something!
